Welcome to the block-game!

The game is based on this tutorial: "React Tetris with Typescript - Build Tetris with typescript - Typescript Tetris" by Weibenfalk https://youtu.be/jEjj2jvHpv4

While I know React and TypeScript are not the best for the job, I just wanted to practice some coding and make something fun :)

There are some bugs in tutorial, I'll post solutions to them in Wiki as my comments have been deleted on YouTube :(
